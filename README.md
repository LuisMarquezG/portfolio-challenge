# Portfolio Challenge

## Description

The idea of this project is to put in practice all the new skills that I learned on week 2 such as flexbox, grid, vars or mediaqueries, how to create internal links in the pages to browse easely on the page and also links that can take the user to external websites. 
Also in this project I am practicing the skills that I gained on week 1 as coding optimization among others.
On the other hand this porfolio can be used to be shown to potencial employers.

## I have learned:

Building this project I have learned a lot of 
- New CSS properties. 
- I have been reading documentation in order to achive the requirements for it.
- I have trying to be creative adding elements that we haven't learn yet but that I have watched in many websites.
- I tried to use % instead px as much as I can.
